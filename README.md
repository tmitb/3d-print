# 3D models
This is a location where I dump all the 3d models that are not specifically related to a project or small enough to form its own project. I do my best to keep `.f3d` and `.stl` files ready for all models to people can simply download to further modify or print them.

# License
Each project has its own license. If not mentioned the default license of the work is CC BY-SA 4.0
